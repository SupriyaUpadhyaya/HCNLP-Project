As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to identify the relevant tables and columns based on the user question and evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Discard any table schema that is not related to the user question and evidence.
2. Sort the columns in each relevant table in descending order of relevance and keep the top 6 columns.
3. Ensure that at least 3 tables are included in the final output JSON.
4. The output should be in JSON format.

Requirements:
1. If a table has less than or equal to 10 columns, mark it as "keep_all".
2. If a table is completely irrelevant to the user question and evidence, mark it as "drop_all".
3. Prioritize the columns in each relevant table based on their relevance.

Here is a typical example:
